About Aisha Aman

Hi, welcome to Github! Here you can find the projects I have done since I started in the field of AI.

Let me tell you about myself. I found my passion for statistics during my Bachelor in Business, where I had the opportunity to build my foundations in probability, statistics and econometrics. 
I wanted to go deeper into this field, so I started a specialisation course in Data Science at the Complutense University of Madrid, 
where I further developed my knowledge of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), as well as learning the pleasure of programming.
As I wanted to further deepen my knowledge, I am currently pursuing a Master in AI at the Universidad Internacional Menendez Pelayo. 
In parallel, I participate in different shared tasks and contests, where I not only put my knowledge into practice, but also have the opportunity to do research. 

This, together with my knowledge in business and finance, gives me a unique set of skills to work on a large number of problems and offer real-world data science solutions.
